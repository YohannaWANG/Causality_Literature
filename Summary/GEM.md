## [Generative Causal Explanations for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06643)

[2021-07-15][gem]

#### Paper Overview & Comments:
This paper formulate the explanability of GNN decision making problem into a causal learning task. Specifically, they train a granger causality model equipped with a loss function. 

#### Key selling point: 
- Explain GNN from a causality point of view;
- Estimate causal effect with causal objectives;
- Incorporate graph rules to ensure valide explanations;

#### Some points I'm confused with
 A sparse computation graph (a sparse subgraph) most relevant for predictiong the outcome. Do they make connections between sparsity of causality?
